# 🧟‍♀️ ScaryZombieChallangeGame! 🧟‍♂️

    -Update: My internship is moving towards the end-date and I've learned many new things!
    		 So I felt that I should use that new knowledge and apply it to this project to
    		 get it towards the finishline!

    		 New repository and created with (was latest when I started this refactoring)
    		 Vite 6.0.5 and React 18.3.1. I've also added state management with Zustand!
    		 It's still R3F, R3F-drei, react-spring, use-geture

    		 I've also added Github Copilot in vsCode and I'm using Claude Sonnet 3.5
    		 both in Copilot and online. The ammount of questions I've been asking is
    		 crazy. Lyckily it doesn't get tired of me(yet?)!

    As my final project at Hyper Island Frontend education I decided to re-make and finish the game I
    started making in the previous module.

    The light(literally) overview of the game is that you are using the mouse to controll a spotlight
    from the players perspective. You are standing in the dark woods and when your light moves over
    a monster it slowly begins to die. If you pinch on your phone or scroll on on your mouse you can
    narrow the lightbeam and the monster will die faster.

    It's now developed with React, React Three Fiber(r3f) and React Spring.

    Unexpectedly I've also spent countless frustrated hours in Blender 💥 to edit models and exporting
    to get it to work with r3f! ⏲🧠💪

## 🧾📕📚 Here are a few of my resources: 💻💾💽

    	** First and foremost. WAWASENSEI! **  https://www.youtube.com/@WawaSensei
    	I've spent many hours now watching his videos and going through his repos!

    	** React three fiber docs, although they are lacking in some aspects: **
    	[https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction]
    	[https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber]

    	React three fiber is a direct overlay ontop of Three js though so everything is
    	destructable.

    	The Poimandres groups have done an enormous job!

    	** The threejs forum. A great source of help and a very nice community! **
    	[https://discourse.threejs.org/]

    	** drei an extension on r3f **

    	** React Spring **
    	[https://www.react-spring.dev/]
    	[https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring]

    	** To optimize glTF models and get a convinient *.jsx to use as a component! **
    	[https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx]

    	** Quaternius! **
    	I've used several of their free models for this project! For example from the Cube World pack,
    	the Ultimate Monster Pack and so on.
